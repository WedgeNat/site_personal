    <p>Here is an inpiring poem I found that you may enjoy: </p>
    <p>
        Determination <br>
        Poet: Louise Mount
    </p>
    <p>
        I will not let life conquer me, <br>
        I will above it rise. <br>
        And when the dark gloom round <br>
        I'll glance into the skies. <br>
        I will not let the little things <br>
        Annoy me hour by hour: <br>
        I'll turn away and look to see <br>
        His beauty in a flower. <br>
        I will not let this earthly house <br>
        Keep all my thoughts in clay. <br>
        My soul must always listen <br>
        To what the angels say. <br>
        I will not let myself forget <br>
        Some loveliness I see, <br>
        For surely I may carry it <br>
        Into eternity. <br>
        I will not let this little span <br>
        Mark a time of weeping; <br>
        A golden voice will whisper that <br>
        I am in His keeping. <br>
        So welcome, life, in soft white robe <br>
        Or in a scarlet dress, <br>
        Oh, play with me and baffle me; <br>
        I have my happiness. <br>
    </p>
